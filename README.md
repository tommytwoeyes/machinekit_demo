Machinekit is a platform for machine control applications.

Machinekit is portable across a wide range of hardware platforms
and real-time environments, and delivers excellent performance at
low cost. It is based on the HAL component architecture, an intuitive
and easy to use circuit model that includes over 150 building blocks
for digital logic, motion, control loops, signal processing, and hardware
drivers. Machinekit supports local and networked UI options, including 
ubiquitous platforms like phones or tablets.

Your imagination is the limit! Machinekit can control machine tools, quadrotors, robots, or your refrigerator.
